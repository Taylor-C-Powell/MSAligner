# Title: nucleotide_to_amino.py

## General Description
This script will convert a nucleotide sequence into an amino acid sequence

## Inputs
- Input 1: nucleotide sequence

## Outputs
- Output 1: amino acid sequence

## Process (step-by-step in plain English)
1. Initialize an empty output string called 'output_string'
2. Read an input nucleotide sequence from a file and place the sequence into a string called 'input_string'
3. For each for each set of three characters (codon) in input_string
4. Input the codon into a dictionary that that functions as a codon table, where codons are keys and amino acids are values
5. Take the resulting amino acid value from the dictionary and append it to output_string
6. Once the last codon from input_string has been read, return output_string
