# Biopython — Part 2

## Overview

Welcome to our second BioPython activity! Your goal is to **replicate all its functionality locally** using **Python scripts** executed in your terminal, not in Colab.

Students should already have completed Part 1 (`Biopython_Part1.md`).

Make sure your environment is properly configured before beginning this exercise.

## Objectives

- Practice using Biopython modules for parsing, sequence manipulation, and data analysis.
- Transition from running code in Colab to developing structured, executable Python3 scripts locally.
- Strengthen your understanding of documentation, modularization, and environment setup.

## Environment Setup

Before starting, you may want to create or activate your Biopython environment:

```bash
conda create -n biopython_env python=3.11
conda activate biopython_env
pip install biopython pandas numpy matplotlib
```

If you already created this environment during Part 1, just activate it again.

## Activity Instructions

Each code block below represents a task. You will now translate each one into a **standalone Python3 script**, using your local terminal.

Each script should include:
- A **shebang line** (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
- A **guard statement** (`if __name__ == '__main__':`)
- **Functions**, and ideally at least one **class**
- **Docstrings and comments** to explain what the code does
- Proper **imports** and clean **output formatting**

Use the terminal on **macOS** or **Linux**, or the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** if you’re on Windows.

## More on Biopython

This notebook brings extra challenges for us to keep practicing and learning Biopython and its usage for handling biological sequence data. You will:

- Read sequences from a FASTA file
- Manipulate sequences with `Seq`
- Use `SeqRecord` for annotations
- Write sequences to files
- Perform basic sequence analysis

## Exercise 1

Recreate this code as a standalone Python script. Test it locally, and if it produces output or files, save them into a `/results` directory.

```python
# TEST IT
import Bio
```

## Exercise 2

Recreate this code as a standalone Python script. Test it locally, and if it produces output or files, save them into a `/results` directory.

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq

my_seq = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
print(my_seq)
print("Complement:", my_seq.complement())
print("Reverse Complement:", my_seq.reverse_complement())
```

## Challenge 1

Transcribe and translate the sequence above.

## Exercise 3

Recreate this code as a standalone Python script. Test it locally, and if it produces output or files, save them into a `/results` directory.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from io import StringIO

fasta_data = """"
>seq1 This is the first
AGTACACTGGT

>seq2 This is the second
GTCACTGGTAC
"""
fasta_io = StringIO(fasta_data)

total_len = 0
count = 0

for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_io, "fasta"):
    print(f"Record's ID: {record.id} ({type(record.id)})\n")
    print(f"Record's description: {record.description} ({type(record.description)})\n")
    print(f"Record's sequence: {record.seq} ({type(record.seq)})\n")
    total_len += len(record)
    count += 1

print(f"Total length: {total_len}")
print(f"Number of records: {count}")
```

## Challenge 2

Count how many sequences are in the file and their total length.

## Exercise 4

Recreate this code as a standalone Python script. Test it locally, and if it produces output or files, save them into a `/results` directory.

```python
from Bio.SeqRecord import SeqRecord
from Bio.Seq import Seq

records_list = []

record1 = SeqRecord(Seq("ATGC"), id="test1", description="A test sequence")
print(record1)
records_list.append(record1)

record2 = SeqRecord(Seq("GATACA"), id="test2", description="A second test sequence")
print(record2)
records_list.append(record2)

print(records_list)
```

## Challenge 3

Create two custom SeqRecords and write to FASTA.

## Exercise 5

Recreate this code as a standalone Python script. Test it locally, and if it produces output or files, save them into a `/results` directory.

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import gc_fraction

for record in records:
    print(record.id, "GC content:", gc_fraction(record.seq))
```

## Challenge 4

Find the sequence with the highest GC content.

## Deliverables

- All Python scripts
- Any resulting output files, text summaries, or data generated by your scripts
- Optional: an updated Markdown log summarizing your observations

Compress everything into a single `.zip` file and upload it to **Canvas** by the beginning of class on **Thursday, October 30**.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- Run Biopython-based analyses locally
- Write modular and reusable Python codes
- Work comfortably in a terminal environment
- Document and organize your projects for reproducibility
