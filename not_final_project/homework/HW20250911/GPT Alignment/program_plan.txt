Here’s the plan for your program:

Input

The script will read the FASTA file you provided (with headers for each organism).

We’ll assume it’s in standard .fna FASTA format (which it is).

Alignment

We’ll use Biopython’s Bio.Align.Applications to call MUSCLE (a widely used multiple sequence aligner).

MUSCLE is lightweight and good for 3 sequences. If MUSCLE isn’t installed, you could easily swap in ClustalOmega.

Scoring

After alignment, we’ll compute:

A similarity score: percentage identity across aligned positions.

A difference score: percentage of mismatches (including gaps).

Output

The alignment will be printed.

The similarity and difference scores will be reported.
