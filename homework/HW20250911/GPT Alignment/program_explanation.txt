How the Program Works

The program takes your FASTA file (HBA1_sequences.fna) containing the three sequences.

It calls MUSCLE to perform a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). The aligned sequences are saved in HBA1_aligned.fna.

The alignment is read back into Python with Biopython.

A consensus sequence is computed, and similarity/difference scores are calculated as follows:

Similarity Score: Percentage of columns in the alignment where all three sequences have the same nucleotide (ignoring gaps).

Difference Score: Simply 100 – similarity.

This approach mimics how bioinformatics alignment tools calculate conservation across multiple sequences, giving you an interpretable similarity/difference measure.
